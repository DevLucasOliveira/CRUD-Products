# CRUD-Products

###### Hello World! This is my first project developed alone, using github to gain knowledge.

Simple CRUD **connected** to the database with the following features:

- To clean
- Delete
- To save


In this Crud you can register products with description and price.
It already contains an auto-increment code.


### Below is an example:

You can also search for a specific product already registered and, with the initials, the table shows the products.


### Using search(description):
